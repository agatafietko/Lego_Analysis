# Lego_Analysis, in this project I look over the lego sets data and analyze it based mostly on the star wars themes:
1) What % of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?
2) In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme?
3) Break down number of sets by year.
4) How many of the sets each year were Star Wars theme?
5) Total sets vs Start Wars sets each year.
